    <i>The Material Parser</i> is a project that has been led in the context of
    a research project at the <a href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/en/">Ecole Des Mines de Saint-Etienne</a>,
    among the SMS research group.
  </p>
  <p class="about">
    Its original motivation is the fact that material manufacturers worldwide usually
    provide datasheets for their material products as unstandardized PDF datasheets.
    However, being able to gather and unify those data from different sources to
    be able to input them, for example, in statistical processes can be very
    important in the context of real experiments, because they are products that
    can be bought directly to providers.

  <p class="about">
    Extract empirical material information from PDF publications and books can also
    be interesting.

  <p class="about">
    <i>The Material Parser</i> allows you to :
  </p>
  <ul class="about">
    <li>Create and manage some <a href="/datasheet_categories">document categories</a>.</li>
    <li>Upload your <a href="/datasheets">PDF datasheets</a> (or other documents) in those categories.</li>
    <li>Apply our process to document subsets in order to extract <b>material compositions</b>.</li>
    <li>Download results as .csv, or save them to a relationnal database.
      Notice that whatever the source or the original format, the extracted data
      will finally be represented using a unique model.</li>
    <li>Consult <a href="/materials">results saved to the database</a> and apply to them basic filtering
      before download them as csv.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="about">
    Our process is based directly on the <a href="https://tabula.technology/">Tabula project</a>,
    and more precisely its <a href="https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java">tabula-java</a> core.
    Basically, you can perform several selections on any number of selected datasheets.
    The algorithm then tries to extract potential composition tables from all the
    datasheets with all the selections using Tabula. A composition is finally considered as
    valid if it is composed of valid elements from the periodic table. For now,
    only english element names (and official symbols) are supported.
